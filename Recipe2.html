    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <em>
        Paneer makhani (also called paneer butter masala) is a slightly sweet
        dish of paneer, originating from the Indian subcontinent, in which the
        gravy is prepared usually with butter (makhan), tomatoes and cashews .
        Spices such as red chili powder and garam masala are also used to
        prepare this gravy. A survey found that paneer butter masala was one of
        the top five foods ordered in India.

      <li>Cream</li>
      <li>Butter</li>

      </ul>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        If using store bought paneer, pour 2 cups of hot water to a bowl. Add
        paneer cubes and rest for about 15 to 20 mins. Later drain the water and
        set aside. This will soften the paneer. If using homemade paneer, skip
        this step.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1 tablespoon oil to a hot pan. Add 2 green cardamoms and 1 cup
        cubed onions. Saute them on a medium flame till they turn transparent or
        lightly pink in color. this takes just 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the following
        <ul>
          <li>1 and 1/2 cups finely chopped tomatoes</li>
          <li>
            3/4 teaspoon salt. Again saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Then cover the
            pan and cook till mushy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        When tomatoes and onions are completely soft cooked and mushy, add the
        following:
        <ul>
          <li>1 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder <strong>(optional)</strong></li>
          <li>12 to 14 cashews</li>
          <li>
            3/4 teaspoon sugar
            <strong>(optional, to balance the flavours)</strong>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Saute this onion tomato masala on a low heat for 2 to 3 minutes. It
        should begin to smell good and aromatic. Turn off the stove.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool this completely and add to a blender. Pour 1 cup water. Blend this
        mixture to a super smooth puree.
        <ul>
          <li>
            To speed up the process, pour ice cold water to the blender jar and
            then transfer the warm mixture.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Blend to a very smooth and silky puree. If your blender is not powerful
        enough to make a fine puree, then strain it through a fine strainer to a
        bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a pan on a low flame with 1 and 1/2 tablespoon butter. When butter
        melts, add all of the following spices. You can skip them if you don't
        have
        <ul>
          <li>2 green cardamoms</li>
          <li>1 bay leaf</li>
          <li>1/2 inch cinnamon piece</li>
          <li>3 cloves</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        When spices begin to sizzle, add 1and 1/2 teaspoon ginger garlic paste.
        Saute for 1 minute or until you begin to smell it good. The raw smell
        should go away. Take care to cook this on a low medium heat. Do not burn
        the paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next pour onion tomato puree. Add 1/4 teaspoon red chilli powder for
        deeper color. This is completely optional. Ensure the stove flame is at
        low otherwise the curry begins to splatter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately pour 1/2 cup water and mix well to bring it to a gravy
        consistency. If it is too thick you can add little more water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook on a medium flame until the gravy turns thick and
        flavourful.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the paneer butter masala gravy is ready, you will see traces of
        fats over the gravy. This is the color you may get. Open the lid and
        cookuntil the gravy turns thicker. Taste test and add amore salt if
        needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure the gravy reaches the desired consistency then add 200 to 250
        grams paneer. Take 1 teaspoon kasuri methi in your palm and crush it
        between bot your palms. Then add butter masala. Avoid adding paneer when
        the gravy is still runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir well. On a low flame cook covered just for 1 to 3 minutes. Cokking
        for longer can make paneer harder. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons cream and
        stir. You should get this thick creamy texture as you see in the picture
        below.
      </li>
