    <p><em>Chicken curry is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is
      common in the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Great Britain, and the
      Caribbean. A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of
      chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavoured with ginger,
      garlic, tomato puree, chilli peppers and a variety of spices, often
      including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, and cardamom. Outside of
      South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture
      known as curry powder.</em>

    <h2><a name="S">Steps</a> </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in heavy bottom pan. When the oil turns
        hot,add
        <ul>
          <li>1 bay leaf</li>
          <li>2 inch cinnamon piece</li>
          <li>4 cloves</li>
          <li>3 green cardamoms</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 cup of finely chopped onions and 1 green chili pepper.Saute the
        onions till they turn golden. To speed up,use another teaspoon of
        oil <strong>(optional)</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 tablespoon of ginger garlic paste. Make sure the onions turn
        golden before adding ginger garlic.
      </li>
      <li>
        Saute ginger garlic for about 2 to 3 minutes or until the raw smell
        disappears completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add half cup tomatoes(chopped, mashed or pureed). Also add quater
        teaspoon turmeric and half teaspoon salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next fry until the tomatoes turn completely mushy and the raw smell has
        gone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add 1 teaspoon red chili powder and quater whisked yogurt.To substitute
        yogurt, you can soak 12 cashew nuts or almonds or 3 tablespoons white
        poppy seeds in half cup hot water for 30 minutes.Blend it smooth paste
        and add here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Saute on a medium flame until the mixture becomes thick and begins to
        smell good. <strong>Optional</strong>- if you do not like chunky onions
        in your curry, then cool and blend this with water to a smooth puree.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the following Ingridients
        <ul>
          <li>Half Kg chicken</li>
          <li>1 teaspoo <strong>Garam Masala</strong>powder</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon coriander powder</li>
          <li>2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves or mint leaves.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Saute for 3 to 4 mins or until the chicken turns pale.</li>
      <li>
        Cover and cook on a low flame for about 3 to 4 mins so that chicken
        absorbs the flavours. Meanwhile, heat 1 cup water in a separate pot. You
        can also microwave the water in a cup for 1 min.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour half to 3 quaters cup of hot water or as needed. Using cold water
        makes the meat tough and hard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure you use just enough water to partially cover the chicken.
        Cover and cook on a low to medium heat until soft tender. It took about
        10 mins for me. This may vary depending on the age of the chicken or the
        size of the pieces. Do not cook on a high temperature.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lastly check whether the chicken is done by pricking it with a fork. It
        must be soft and should fall of the bone easily. Taste the curry and add
        more salt if needed. Also add quater teaspoon more garam masala if curry
        feels low on flavour.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the curry reaches desired consistency switch off the stove. Add
        some coriander leaves for garninsh. Keep covered until serving.
