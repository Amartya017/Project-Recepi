      <li>
        Clean 1 and 1/2 cups poha and add them to a large colander, strainer or
        bowl or pot. Please note that to make non sticky poha, you will need to
        use thick or medium flakes. If you use thin flakes poha will turn mushy
        after rinsing them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quickly rinse them well with clean filtered water. Drain the water
        completely. Repeat the rinse and drain the water completely. Usually
        done twice but if the flattened rice feels to mushy after the first
        rinse then don't rinse further. keep bowl aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile chopped 1 medium sized onion and 1 to 2 green chilies. Also
        rinse the curry leaves and corriander leaves. Fine chop the coriander
        leaves. if you want to use potatoes then chop them to half inch cubes
        and keep them immersed in water until needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check if poha has softened by pressing down a few flakes in between your
        thumb and fore finger. Run your finger acress the flattened rice to
        break lumps if any. Poha would have absorbed water and softened in about
        5 to 7 mins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a pan with 1/2 tablespoon oil and fry the peanuts until golden and
        crunchy. Set them aside for garnishing. This way peanuts remain crunchy.
        You can also dry roast the pranuts if you prefer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat the same pan with 1 to 1 and 1/2 tablespoon oil. When the oil
        becomes hot, add 3/4 teaspoon mustard seeds and 3/4 teaspoon cumin
        seeds. Let them splutter.
      </li>
      <li>Add chopped onions, green chilies adn curry leaves.</li>
      <li>
        Saute until the onions turn pink. If using potatoes, drain the water
        completely and add the cubes to the pan. Saute for 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pan and cook on a low heat untill the potatoes are soft
        cooked. If needed you may add more oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the potatoes are cooked thoroughly, you can saute them on a figh
        flame for 1 to 2 mins. Add turmeric.
      </li>
      <li>Add softened poha and mix well.</li>
      <li>
        Cover and steam on a low heat until poha becomes hot. Stir in between to
        prevent burning. If you feel your poha is too dry, the you may sprinkle
        some water in between. When done it should be soft and not mushy.
        Sprinkle coriander leaves and roasted peanuts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take it off the heat. Taste and add some salt if needed. Add lemon juice
        and keep it covered until served.
